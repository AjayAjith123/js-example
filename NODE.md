1) Why npm?
=> npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. 
   npm install/downloads a package and it's dependencies
   It is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.
   
2) why npm -g , save-dev?
=> npm -g is used in installing a flag globally.
   -g tells npm to install the named module so that it's accessible globally.
   other ways to install -  npm install <packagename> , npm install <packagename> --save , npm install <package_name> --save-dev
   save -dev
