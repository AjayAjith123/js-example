1) Explain the following:
a) Database
=> A database -> Organised collection of information/data.
   Data       -> Data is the name given to basic facts and entities such as names and numbers. A data can be anything such as Images, sounds, multimedia etc.

b) What is ACID property?
=> ACID abreviated as A = Automicity,C = Consistency,I = Isolation,D = Durability
   ACID property defines how a database should be.
   This can be well explained by using a term transaction. A transaction can be anything either a money transaction, message etc.
   Transactions access data using read and write operations.

   ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.
 * Automicity   - The entire transaction takes place at once or doesn't happen at all.
                  If there is transaction between "A" and "B", the transacction can take place and be successful or cannot take place at all.

 * Consistency  - The database must be consistent before and after the transaction.
                  If there is transaction between "A" and "B",the flow between the transaction should be consistent(here,show the data as it is).

 * Isolation    - Multiple Transactions occur independently without interference 
                  If there is transaction between "A" and "B" and "c" and "D", the transaction will be parallel but the output should be serial. 

 * Durability   - The changes of a successful transaction occures even if the system failure occurs.
                  When a transaction occurs, if there is any disturbance/system, failure the data will be stored in a disc and can be retrieved whenever we switch on the system back.


c) Normalization
=> Way of organising data in database.
   Every data in database has to be in normal form.
   normalization came into existence because of the problems that occurred on data.
   Data Anomalies -
   * Insertion
   * Updation
   * Deletion
Normalization divides the larger table into the smaller table and links them using relationship.
   why normalization?
   - to avoid redundancy : repeated data cannot be in one table with simiar content.
   - to avoid Insertion,Deletion and Update anomalies 

The database normalization process is divided into following the normal form:
1) First Normal Form (1NF)
   Each column or row should have only single value attribute.
   The table should be atomic(an operation appears to occur at a single instant between its invocation and its response).

2) Second Normal Form (2NF)
   Table should be 1NF.
   There should not be partial dependency.
   Functional dependency - Each and every other column should be dependent on the the Primary key(unique key).
   Partial Dependency - here, a nonprime attribute is functionally dependent on part of a candidate key(two primary key-data to be found with two other data).

3) Third Normal Form (3NF)
   Table should be 2NF.
   There should not be Transitive dependency.
   For ex - 
   Column C -> Depend on -> Column B
   Column B -> Depend on -> Column A
   So Column C -> Depend on -> Column A (where A is a Primary Key) 
   so here, column C is indirectly dependent on column A via column B. This is called Transitive dependency.

4) Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
   Table should be in 3NF.
   There should not be reverse dependency.
   For every dependency B -> A, A is super key.(This condition should not exist)
   
5) Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
   Table should be in Boyce codd normal form.
   There must not be multivalued dependency.
   For ex - if there two different columns are dependent on one other column.this is multivalued dependency.
   For a dependency A â†’ B, if for a single value of A, multiple values of B exists, then the relation will be a multi-valued dependency.

6) Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
   table should be in 4NF
   Does not contains any join dependency and joining should be lossless.
   

d) DDl? DML?
=>
1) DDL
   DDL is abbreviated as Data Definition Language
   It deals with the database schemas and descriptions, basically of how the data should be stored in the database.
* CREATE - to create a database and its objects like (table, index, views, store procedure, function, and triggers)
* ALTER - alters the structure of the existing database
* DROP - delete objects from the database
* TRUNCATE - remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
* COMMENT - add comments to the data dictionary
* RENAME - rename an object

2) DML 
   It is abbreviated as Data manipulation Language.
   It deals with data manipulation and includes most common SQL statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., and 
   It is used to store, modify, retrieve, delete and update data in a database.
* SELECT - retrieve data from a database
* INSERT - insert data into a table
* UPDATE - updates existing data within a table
* DELETE - Delete all records from a database table
* MERGE - UPSERT operation (insert or update)
* CALL - call a PL/SQL or Java subprogram
* EXPLAIN PLAN - interpretation of the data access path
* LOCK TABLE - concurrency Control


e) Joins
=> A JOIN is a clause that is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
* INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
Syntax -
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

* LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
Syntax - 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

* RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
Syntax - SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

* FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
Syntax - 
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

f) VIEW in SQL
=> 
* Virtual table(can be seen as a table but does not contain any value) that  contains data(column names) from one or multiple tables. 
* It does not hold any data and does not exist physically in the database.
* We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables in a database
* A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition.
* Views can join and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table. 

g) Views over Query
=> 
* A query exists only when one executes it - not saved in server
* View is a query saved in server ..
* Views are usually virtual and do not occupy space in systems.
*  helps to hide some of the columns in a table.
*  it can draw data from multiple tables and execute it in single table.
*  The table is an independent data object while views are usually depending on the table.

h) SQL GROUP BY Statement
=> 
*  to arrange identical data into groups with the help of functions.
* for example - if a particular column has same values in different rows then it will arrange these rows in a group.
* Syntax : SELECT column1, function_name(column2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2
ORDER BY column1, column2;

function_name: Name of the function used for example, SUM() , AVG().
table_name: Name of the table.
condition: Condition used.

i) SQL FUNCTIONS
=> Functions are methods used to perform data operations.
Two categories:
--> Aggregate Functions
--> Scalar Functions

1) AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS - Mathematical Calculations
* These functions -> perform calculations on a group of values and then return a single value
Some of the functions are :
i) SUM() -> used to return the sum of a group of values.

ii) COUNT() -> return the no. of rows and columns based on a certain condition or without a condition.

iii) AVG() -> calculate avg value of a numeric column.

iv) MIN() -> returns minimum value of a column.

v) MAX() -> returns maximum values of a column.

vi) FIRST() -> return the first value of the column.

vii) LAST() -> returns last value of a column.


2) SCALAR FUNCTIONS
* to return a single value from the given input value.
functions :
i) LCASE() -> to convert string column values to lowercase

ii) UCASE() -> to convert a string column values to Uppercase.

iii) LEN() -> Returns the length of the text values in the column.

iv) MID() -> Extracts substrings in SQL from column values having String data type.

v) ROUND() -> Rounds off a numeric value to the nearest integer.

vi) NOW() -> to return the current system date and time.

vii)FORMAT() -> to format how a field must be displayed.
