1) Why use a framework instead of a library
=> 
* When you have a library you need to understand the functionality of each method and it is relatively hard to create complex interactions since you need to invoke many methods to get to results. 
* Frameworks, on the other hand, contain the basic flow and since you only need to plug in your behavior it is easier to do the right thing. 

2) DOM -> Document Object Model
=>
* When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
* The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents.
* The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
* The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents.
* HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

3) REACT JS
=> 
* React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* React is used to build single page applications.
* React allows us to create reusable UI components.
> npm install -g create-react-app - Install create-react-app by running this command
> npx create-react-app myfirstreact - create a React application named myfirstreact
> cd myfirstreact - move to the directory
> 

4) JSX - Javascript XML
=> 
* it is an inline markup that looks like HTML and gets transformed to JavaScript.
* follows XML rule.
* Syntax - const element = <h1>Welcome to GeeksforGeeks.</h1>;
* It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code)
