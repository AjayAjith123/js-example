API? (Application Programming Interface)
     => API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
     => Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you’re using an API.
 
    HTTP API?( Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
     => A web API is a protocol that describes how your clients can access resources and what methods work with your architecture.
     => An HTTP API is an API that uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol as the communication protocol between the two systems. HTTP APIs expose endpoints as API gateways for HTTP requests to have access to a server.
       =>For example, you use an HTTP API every time you set a Zoom meeting in your Google calendar. The API defines how Zoom can communicate directly with Google’s servers to embed a Zoom meeting into the event rather than having to copy and paste the meeting invitation into a field.
    
    REST Api?
          => REST API stands for Representational State Transfer and is an architectural pattern for creating web services.
          => REST is a ruleset that defines best practices for sharing data between clients and the server.
          =>  It’s essentially a design style used when creating HTTP or other APIs that asks you to use CRUD functions only, regardless of the complexity. REST applications use HTTP methods like GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT.
          =>  REST emphasizes the scalability of components and the simplicity of interfaces.
