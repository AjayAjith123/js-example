NODE JS:
         # node.js is a open source environment runtime in various plat form.   
         # javascriptcode--->machine code.
         # using v8 engine and c++ , it is created.
         # it execiutes line by line.it is single threading and non blocking.
         # node needs a code editor to run ,e.g= vs code(we can install node and use it.)
         # node provides various javascript module re usable packages using NPM(node package    manager),which we can use it for webdevelopment applications.
         # node has an inbulit module called HTTP.it allow to transfer data over the hype text  transfer protocol.
         # to include this module we need to use require() methoud.
         # we can also create a http server using create server() methoud .


 EXPRESS JS:
          
           # it is a web framework for javascript.when we want to make a website using javascript.so javascript uses express js.it is a light weight web application for node.
           # for webdevelopment no all task is supported by node ,so to add specific handling request like get,post,put etc  we use express.js to create node web framework
             
   why do we need a framework?
          web fframework is designed to support the development of web applications.web framework provides standard build applications.
          frameowrks is created to make web development faster and easy.    

WHY EXPRESS JS:
           using express js we can easily create web applications.it provides routing for requests given by client server.
           without express js we need to create our own code which takes many time and power.so using expressjs we can shorten the work by giving request etc
           we can use express middle ware for various error handling

     express middle ware:
          #  middle ware packages  is an additional requests for handling the request.it is   like  request inside the request/response cycle
          # these middleware is used to execute anycode.make changes to request/response objects or to call another middleware function.
          # for example in post methoud we use body-parser middleware to recognise the string or text in the request bodies.
