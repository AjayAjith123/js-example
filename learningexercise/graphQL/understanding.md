Rest API and Graph QL:


Rest API:
   rest api uses basic http protocols =Http CRUD 
   in rest api ,client  triggers multiple calls to server .
   in rest api we use one or more end points.
   for every request we need to hit seperate api .
   for e.x= /user/<id>,
            /user/<id>/posts
            /user/<id>/followers.
    rest api has the problem of underfetching and over fetching.

       graphQl is a query language for api.
       it is a replace of rest api.
       ask for what you need is get exactly that.it gives the data what the user exacty asks for and no more extra data .
       graph ql server has only one end point.
       we can get the needed response in a single request.
                                .
