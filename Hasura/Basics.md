GraphiQl tool -> used to interact with the API.

Mutation -> write/post values

Relationships
=> enable us to make nested object(1 object within another object) queries if the table/views in our database are connected

GraphQL schema relationships can be either of
* Object relationships (one-to-one)
  returns one particular object from the desired table.
  For ex -> If we need todo list for one particular user then it is object relationship.

* Array relationships (one-to-many)
  here we are able to fetch users for every particular user, so the todo can be many. a user can write more than 1 todo. hence this can be one to many relationship. it returns an array of objects.
